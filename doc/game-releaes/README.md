## N64 SDK Version

When development started around May 1997 [[4]], the most recent N64 OS (part of the N64 SDK) was version **2.0H**, with release notes dated on 1997-02-24. So development probably started with that version. The most recent N64 OS at the time of the release/version dates was version **2.0J** (release notes dated on 1999-02-01) or even 2.0J Patch 1 (release notes dated on 1999-03-19). The N64 Microcode also implies version **2.0J**.
