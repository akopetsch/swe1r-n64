## Development Timeline

Development began around about May 1997:

> [Cory Ryans:] How long has Racer been in development?
> 
> [Brett Tosti:] The game has been in development for approximately 2 years now. The two project leaders were working on Shadows of the Empire and began work on Racer after Shadows of the Empire was completed.

Note that Shadows of the Empire was released between 1996-12-02 and 1997-06-14 for N64. [[1]], [[2]]

## N64 vs PC

Seems like the N64 version is the base and that the PC version is a port:

> [Cory Ryans:] What differences are there between the N64 edition of Racer and the PC version?
> 
> [Brett Tosti:] We had 5 programmers working specifically on PC related features. For example, we have added force feedback control options to the PC edition as well as other features. The N64 title is similar to the PC version in many ways, but because the PC is the more powerful platform a lot of features were added.

## Graphics

> In Racer we are using **vertex fog** and **table fog** but if the card doesnâ€™t support a certain fog effect we try to make up for that cards lack of feature set and maintain graphic quality.
