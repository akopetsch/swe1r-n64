The ucode has the following [signature](/rom/print-ucode-sigs.md):

```text
RSP Gfx ucode F3DEX.NoN   fifo 2.08  Yoshitaka Yasumoto 1999 Nintendo.
```

That is the signature of ``gspF3DEX2.NoN.fifo.o`` that was released with **N64 OS 2.0J** [[1]]. 
MD5 checksums match. [[2]] The object file did not change with later versions of the N64 OS. [TODO: source]
